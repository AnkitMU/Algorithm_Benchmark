# **Benchmark Generation Algorithm**

This repository contains the implementation of a **Benchmark Generation Algorithm** designed to generate, validate, and evaluate benchmarks for various computational tasks. The algorithm is specifically tailored for Object Constraint Language (OCL) constraints, providing tools for generating realistic benchmarks in model-driven engineering scenarios.

---

## **Features**
- Automated generation of benchmarks with configurable parameters.
- Validation of generated benchmarks for correctness.
- Performance evaluation and comparison of algorithms using generated benchmarks.
- Support for multiple input formats (e.g., XML, Ecore).
- Extensible for different domains and use cases.
